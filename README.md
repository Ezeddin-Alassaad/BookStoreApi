# Our Book Store API is a RESTful API built using Node.js and the Express framework. It allows users to perform various operations related to books and authors, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting books and authors.
The API is built using the Mongoose ODM to define our data models and interact with our MongoDB database. We have separate models for books and authors, with a one-to-many relationship between authors and books.
Our API is thoroughly tested using Postman to ensure that it functions as expected.
our Book Store API is a reliable and scalable solution for managing books and authors. Whether you are building a web or mobile app, our API can be easily integrated to provide a seamless user experience."
